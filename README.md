# Test-Table

Testing grounds for a round robin(TurnTable-like) Spotify App

Guidelines for running a developer app can be found at https://developer.spotify.com/technologies/apps/guidelines/developer/

The gist of it follows below

NOTE: You need to enable your Spotify account as a Developer Account.

## Setup

```sh
mkdir ~/Spotify
git clone https://github.com/mykebates/test-table.git ~/Spotify/test-table
open 'spotify:app:test-table'
```


### Todo
- ~~Get Pusher Presence channels running so there is info about room members~~
- ~~Get a rough implementation of drag/drop playlists running~~
- Make playlists function in round robin fashion
- Enable album and track in addition to playlist for drag/drop adding
- Jazz up the design - [@bradhilldesign](https://twitter.com/bradhilldesign) amirite?
